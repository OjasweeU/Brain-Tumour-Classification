High level overview
This project is an end to end deep learning pipeline for brain tumour classification from MRI images, combined with model explainability using Grad CAM.
The goal was not only to predict the tumour type, but also to visualise which regions of the MRI influenced the model’s decision, which is critical in medical AI.
The model classifies MRI scans into four mutually exclusive classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumour, and no tumour.
