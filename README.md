# Brain-Tumour-Classification
Brain tumour classification from MRI images using EfficientNetB1 with Grad-CAM based visual explainability.

**📌 Overview**

This project focuses on brain tumor classification from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on EfficientNetB1.
In addition to achieving high classification performance, the project emphasizes model interpretability by applying Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to visualize tumor-relevant regions in MRI scans.

The goal is to build an accurate and explainable deep learning model suitable for medical imaging applications.
